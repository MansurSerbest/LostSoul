This project consist of 1 level of a 3D sidescroller game.

The coding part of this game is entirely made by me. I used both Blueprint and C++. The movement component of the character uses a finite state machine by using inheritance froma base state class. This finite state machine makes it easy to add different states: running, jumping, wallSlide, etc...
