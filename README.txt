This project consist of a single level of a 3D sidescroller game.

The coding part of this game is entirely made by me. 
I used both Blueprint and C++, and combined them two by means of C++/Blueprint communication.
The movement component of the character uses a finite state machine by using inheritance from a base state class.
This finite state machine makes it easy to add different states: running, jumping, wallSlide, etc...
